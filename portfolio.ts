    A modular transformer manufacturing company operating in the energy systems sector had
built a strong position in the Lithuanian market over many years. Its production infrastructure,
processes, and commercial focus were optimized for a stable domestic demand
environment.
<br/>
That environment changed abruptly.
<br/>
A sudden 70% reduction in public investment into energy system upgrades triggered a
sector-wide shock. Local demand collapsed, contracts disappeared, and revenue visibility
deteriorated within months. The company absorbed a €600,000 loss, placing operational
continuity under pressure.
<br/>
The challenge was not technical capability or product quality. The challenge was structural.
Production assets were highly specialized, commercial activity was concentrated in one
market, and decision-making had been shaped by a single demand source. When that
source disappeared, the entire system was exposed.
    </p>`,
    solution: `<p>
The role of Rotomskis Joint Ventures focused on restoring control through integration rather
than short-term fixes.
<br/>
Work began with strategic sessions to redefine the company’s market logic — identifying
export niches where existing production capabilities could remain competitive without
requiring major capital reinvestment. This reframed expansion not as diversification, but as
selective market repositioning.
<br/>
In parallel, a dedicated export sales structure was formed to operate outside the domestic
market. Commercial leadership, partner outreach, and sales execution were aligned around
a single expansion sequence, prioritizing trust-building and long-term customer relationships
over rapid volume growth.
<br/>
As integration replaced fragmentation, execution regained coherence.
<br/>
Over a two-year period, revenue increased from €4 million to €9 million, restoring
operational stability and reversing the prior losses. The company returned to profitability with
<strong>€450,000 in net profit</strong>  and established a diversified export presence across Scandinavian
and German markets, significantly reducing dependency on domestic public investment
cycles.

    A long-established garment manufacturing company had operated for years under a price-

it a known supplier in its segment. This model functioned as long as labor costs remained
low and competitive pressure was manageable.

That environment changed gradually, then decisively.
<br/>
As labor costs in Lithuania increased, the company’s cost structure became unsustainable.
Competing on price was no longer viable, yet no alternative operating logic had been
defined. Over a five-year period, turnover declined by more than 90%, pushing the business
into a prolonged crisis with no clear path forward.

toward higher-value products and specialized services, where expertise and flexibility
mattered more than unit cost.

In parallel, a new market positioning and marketing logic were developed to support this
shift. Rather than outsourcing sales responsibility, ownership was re-engaged directly in the
commercial process — rebuilding relationships, opening new conversations, and restoring
credibility with higher-value clients.

stabilized.

A significant portion of the client portfolio generated low margins or direct losses. Internal
capacity was misaligned, with team members whose competencies no longer matched the

    A sports and performance retail business (integrated with manufacturing in the country) had
been built around physical sales channels and direct customer interaction. For years, this
model delivered steady results. The COVID-19 crisis disrupted that foundation almost
overnight.
<br/>
Foot traffic declined sharply, in-store sales stalled, and the existing operating model lost its
primary growth engine. While demand for sports and wellness products did not disappear, it
<br/>
shifted rapidly toward digital channels that the business was not yet prepared to serve at
scale.
<br/>
The challenge was not product relevance. It was channel dependency.
      </p>`,
    solution: `<p>
    The role focused on rebuilding the growth engine by expanding e-commerce into a core
commercial channel rather than a supporting function.
<br/>
Work began with a reassessment of the company’s commercial structure to identify where
digital execution could replace lost physical reach. E-commerce capabilities were
strengthened, processes were aligned to support online demand, and sales execution was
reorganized to ensure consistency across digital touchpoints.
<br/>
Rather than treating online sales as a temporary response to crisis conditions, the operating
model was adjusted to integrate e-commerce as a permanent pillar of growth.
<br/>
As digital execution matured, performance recovered and accelerated.
<br/>
Post-crisis, revenue increased by 55%, driven by a more balanced channel mix and
improved ability to convert demand beyond physical locations. The business emerged with a
more resilient commercial structure, less exposed to single-channel disruption.

    A specialized spine and rehabilitation clinic operated with strong clinical expertise and a
growing patient base. While treatment quality was high, internal knowledge transfer and
training consistency depended heavily on individual practitioners and informal processes.
As the clinic expanded, this created variation.
<br/>
Treatment approaches, rehabilitation protocols, and patient guidance were not always
applied consistently across the team. At the same time, patient engagement outside the
clinic remained limited, reducing continuity of care between visits.
<br/>
The constraint was not medical competence. It was the absence of a unified operating
system for training and patient interaction.
                                  </p>`,
    solution: `<p>
    The role focused on strengthening internal capability while extending care beyond physical
sessions.
<br/>
Work began with the design and implementation of an internal training management system,
allowing the clinic to standardize rehabilitation methodologies, onboard staff more effectively,
<br/>
and maintain consistent quality across practitioners. Knowledge became systematized rather
than person-dependent.
<br/>
In parallel, a digital patient-facing application — Care+ — was developed and launched. The
app enabled patients to follow personalized exercise programs, access guidance remotely,
and maintain continuity of rehabilitation outside the clinic environment.
<br/>
As internal training and external engagement became integrated, operational clarity
improved and revenues soared by 87 %.
<br/>
The clinic gained greater control over service quality, reduced internal friction, and extended
its care model beyond in-person appointments. Patients experienced more consistent
treatment paths, while the organization built a scalable foundation for future growth and
service expansion.

    A growing segment of fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers faced a recurring
challenge when entering the Nigerian market. Demand existed, distribution capacity existed,
and local dealers operated actively — yet these elements remained disconnected.
<br/>
Manufacturers struggled to identify reliable distributors at scale. Dealers lacked structured
access to quality producers and consistent product flow. Market entry depended heavily on
informal networks, fragmented relationships, and manual coordination, limiting growth for
both sides.
<br/>
The constraint was not demand or supply. It was market connectivity.
    </p>`,
    solution: `The role focused on designing a system capable of integrating fragmented market actors
into a functioning distribution network.
<br/>
An AI-powered platform was developed to map, match, and coordinate FMCG
manufacturers with verified dealers across Nigeria. Rather than acting as a marketplace in
the traditional sense, the platform was designed as an operating layer — structuring
relationships, enabling qualification on both sides, and supporting scalable distribution logic.
<br/>
Data-driven matching replaced ad-hoc introductions. Manufacturer onboarding, dealer
segmentation, and distribution readiness were aligned within a single system, reducing
friction and increasing speed without sacrificing control.
<br/>
As the platform went live, manufacturers gained structured access to local distribution
networks, while dealers connected to consistent product pipelines aligned with market
demand.`,
